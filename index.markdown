I am a creative problem solver designing and building a better web at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/). I am a visual problem solver with interests in both designing beautiful websites and writing the front-end code to make them work.

In my spare time I take on the occasional freelance branding or design project.

My main website is currently under construction. In the meantime, you can view my work on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/aspencer_ginger), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/andrew_spencer), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/1.ginger/) or connect via [email](mailto:connect@andrew-spencer.com).
