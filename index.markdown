Andrew Spencer is a designer and web developer who thrives in the space where design meets frontend development. He carries a unique balance of creativity and logic—a harmonious combination for a designer who codes. Always honing his craft, Andrew seeks out new challenges to push his knowledge of modern CSS, semantic and accessible HTML, and thoughtful design. He is currently a Frontend Designer at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/) where he works with a variety of clients—from e-commerce to start-ups.

When Andrew isn’t solving complex problems with design and code, he spends time traveling and [photographing](https://www.instagram.com/iam_aspencer/) the world around him. He enjoys exploring new cities, trails, and ski slopes while on a quest for the perfect coffee, tacos, and clam chowder. You can follow him on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/iam_aspencer/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/iam_aspencer), or read some of his [writing](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/author/andrew_spencer).
